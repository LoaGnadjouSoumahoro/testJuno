        llaboration around family projects and chores. Join the waiting list
        Managing a family and a home is like managing a company and its
        employees for free. It is constant micro-management and having to keep
        track with everyone’s everything can be quite polluting and tiring,
        especially mentally. Our app is a digital family assistant designed to
        anticipate needs and reduce the mental burden caused by family, pet, and
        household management. It is an app that stores important documents for
        families and their household. These documents go from passports and
        vaccine cards to practical information on the boiler for example. Then,
        it creates reminders associated to those documents like passport and
        vaccine renewals for everyone, boiler maintenance or repair. The app
        also involves the whole family in events through to-dos, reminders and
        calendars. iJuno app ensures that the whole family is up to date on
        events like family vacations, birthdays and everyone’s own daily tasks
        like walking the dog out, emptying the dishwasher, going to sports
        practice etc…
